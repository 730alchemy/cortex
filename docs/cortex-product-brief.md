# Cortex

## Product Summary

Cortex improves how knowledge is created and used to develop software products. The current method relies on multiple individuals creating, maintaining, and finding knowledge assets (documents, notes, wiki pages, etc). This creates several problems:

- related knowledge distributed across multiple sources
- knowledge conflicts and gaps due to knowledge distribution
- time wasted trying to find and piece together the right knowledge

Cortex changes the paradigm from "create and find knowledge assets" to "chat with AI-driven systems to create and find knowledge". The goals of Cortex are

- make it fast and pleasant for users to find the knowledge they need
- improve the quality of knowledge
- remove the ambiguity of where to add knowledge
