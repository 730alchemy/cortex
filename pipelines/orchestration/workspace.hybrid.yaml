# Hybrid: some in Docker, some local
# Useful when developing one project while others run in containers
load_from:
  # Option 1: This project running locally (via gRPC code server)
  # Start with: make code-server
  - grpc_server:
      host: host.docker.internal  # Special DNS name to reach host machine
      port: 4000
      location_name: cortex_pipeline_local

  # Option 2: This project in Docker (uncomment to use instead of Option 1)
  # - grpc_server:
  #     host: dagster-user-code
  #     port: 4000
  #     location_name: cortex_pipeline_docker

  # Option 3: Another project running locally (via Python file)
  # No gRPC server needed, loads code directly
  # - python_file:
  #     relative_path: ../../projectb/orchestration/definitions.py
  #     location_name: projectb_local

  # Option 4: Another project running locally (via gRPC code server on different port)
  # Start with: cd ../projectb && make code-server (on port 4001)
  # - grpc_server:
  #     host: host.docker.internal
  #     port: 4001
  #     location_name: projectb_local
